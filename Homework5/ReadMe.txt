The method mySQLConnection() has the necessary connection to write from MobileApp.java to the Olap MySQL database. 

The method SQLiteConnection() has the necessary connection information to read and write to each id.sqlite database.

In the zip file I've included the SQLite and MYSQL jar files I used to compile my program.
